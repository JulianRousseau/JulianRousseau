### About me

### Since I was 11 I always had interest and curiosity on technology, at that age I started to modify my cell phone, ps3 and pc to have some advantage in games ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‚.

### After finishing high school I started studying programming and continued until this days with the same love and curiosity that I had at 11 when i modified my firsts games.

### Today I'm proudly enjoying an scholarship that I received from Digital House, Mercado Libre and Globant for the new "Certified Tech Developer" career, where I'm learning about front end, back end, databases, testing, infrastructure, agile methodologies and soft skills.

## Currently doing the second year, a specialization on front end which is my favourite stack. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/javascript/javascript-original.svg" alt="javascript" width="20" height="20"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/css3/css3-plain-wordmark.svg" alt="css3"  width="20" height="20"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/html5/html5-original-wordmark.svg" alt="html5"  width="20" height="20"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/react/react-original-wordmark.svg" alt="react" width="20" height="20"/>
